The solution is a GenAI Document Summarization System that enables users to upload complex documents such as Requests for Proposals (RFPs) or Expressions of Interest (EOIs) and quickly receive meaningful summaries. Additionally, the system features an interactive chatbot to provide instant assistance, enhance user engagement, and answer specific questions about the uploaded RFP/EOI.

# Key Features:
1.	Document Ingestion:
Users upload their documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.) via a user-friendly interface. These documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket for processing.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
a.	AWS Lambda functions preprocess uploaded documents, extracting text.
b.	Preprocessing includes format conversion (e.g., PDF to text) to prepare for AI summarization.
3.	AI-Powered Summarization:
a.	Leveraging Amazon Bedrock, the system uses foundation models (FMs) for summarization.
b.	Summaries are concise, meaningful, and highlight key details from the uploaded RFP document.
4.	Interactive Chatbot:
a.	The solution includes an AI-driven chatbot powered by Amazon Bedrock’s language models.
b.	The chatbot allows users to ask questions about the document or its summary, enabling dynamic, real-time interaction.
5.	Result Storage and Access:
a.	Summarized content is stored in Amazon S3 bucket for retrieval.
b.	Metadata is saved in Amazon DynamoDB for easy querying.
6.	User Interaction Interface:
a.	A frontend interface allows users to upload documents, view summaries, and interact with the chatbot.
b.	APIs exposed via Amazon API Gateway enable integration with external applications or systems.

# Key Benefits:
•	Automates tedious summarization tasks, reducing time and effort.
•	The interactive chatbot enhances user experience, allowing detailed exploration of RFP/EOI document content without manually searching.
•	Scalable and reliable due to AWS-managed infrastructure.
•	Combines cutting-edge NLP models and serverless architecture for high performance and cost efficiency.

I.	User Uploads Document: The user uploads the RFP/EOI document via a pre-signed URL generated by an AWS Lambda function.

II.	Document Stored in S3: The document is securely uploaded and stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

III.	S3 Event Triggers Processing: An S3 event notification triggers an AWS Lambda function to start text extraction.

IV.	Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller, manageable chunks by the Lambda function for efficient processing.

V.	Summarization by Bedrock: Each chunk is sent to Amazon Bedrock, specifically using the Anthropic Claude-V2 Model, to generate concise summaries.

VI.	Summary Aggregation: The summarized chunks are combined into a cohesive final summary.

VII.	Summary Stored: The final summarized document is saved in Amazon S3 bucket.

VIII.	Interactive Chatbot: Users can query the raw text through a chatbot powered by Amazon Bedrock.

IX.	Metadata Tracking: Amazon DynamoDB tracks metadata such as upload status, processing progress, and interaction history.

Flowchart Overview:
1.	Start → User interacts with the Frontend.
2.	Frontend requests a Pre-Signed URL from API Gateway.
3.	API Gateway triggers Lambda 1 to generate a Pre-Signed URL.
4.	Lambda 1 generates and returns the URL to the Frontend via API Gateway.
5.	Frontend uploads the document to S3 using the Pre-Signed URL.
6.	S3 triggers a S3 Event when the upload is complete.
7.	S3 Event activates Lambda 2 for OCR Processing.
8.	Lambda 2 extracts text and stores it back in S3.
9.	Lambda 1 sends the extracted text to AWS Bedrock for summarization.
10.	AWS Bedrock analyzes and returns the summary to Lambda 1.
11.	Lambda 1 stores metadata in DynamoDB and sends the summary back to the Frontend via API Gateway.
12.	End → The user views the summarized document on the Frontend.
